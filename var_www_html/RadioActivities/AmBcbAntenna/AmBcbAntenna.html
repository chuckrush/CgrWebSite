					<p>The initial motivation for building an AM signal source was so I could characterize
						the performance of a 2X2 foot box loop antenna I built a few years ago. 
						You can read about the transmitter design 
						<a href="/RadioActivities/OneMhzTransmitter/OneMhzTransmitter.html" target="_blank">here.</a> 
						and initial tests my father and I did during our 
						<a href="/RadioActivities/RandDExpeditionOct2020/RandDExpeditionOct2020.html" target="_blank">October, 2020 R&D Expedition.</a>
					</p>
					<p>My father and I are smarter now than we were in October, 2020. We decided we needed to build
						a better antenna so we could characterize the performance of the box loop antenna 
						in the far field of the signal source.
					</p>
					<p>So, off to the internet I went, looking for information. I got lucky and found the 
						<a href="/RadioActivities/AmBcbAntenna/Documents/lpamhandbook.pdf" target="_blank">Low Power AM Broadcasters Handbook</a>
						by Kyle Drake. This is an excellent source. My antenna design is strongly based off his.
					</p>
					<p>The primary design constraint for me was transportability. I live in White Plains, New York,
						and my father, the electronics expert, lives in Columbus, Ohio. I designed the antenna so
						it breaks down in to sections that fit in my Maxda CX5 and can be transported on an airplane. 
					</p>
					<p>
						For our first set of tests, V1 of the antenna, I drove to Columbus. For the second set
						of test, V2 of the antenna, I flew. I purchased a Thule Round Trip 175 cm ski roller bag and 
						transported the antenna parts in it. The radiating element, a 1/2 inch, 10 foot copper pipe, 
						of course was not transportable by either method. I purchased a 10 foot, 1/2 inch copper pipe 
						at Home Depot near my dad's house.

					<p>
						I bought the Simspon Fence Post Spike from Home Depot. It is nice and sturdy and did the trick. When removing 
						from the ground it was very tolerant of the rough handling needed to loosen it and pull it out of the ground. 
						For the V2 tests in Ohio, it added too much weight to my luggage so I left it at home. In Ohio, I bought a
						similar product from Home Depot. It was much lighter weight. It was not satisfactory. It broke the first time 
						I was loosening it to pull it out of the ground. Be advised, spend the money to get the heavier one.
					</p>
					<p>
						The 4X4 slides in to the fence post spike. I used some wood shims to tighten it up. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The coil eleement sets on top of the 4X4 and is secured with dowel rods.

					<p>
						One of the references I consulted used wire alligator clip jumpers to connect 
						the tuning capacitors to the coil and the coil to the radiating element. Our version 
						1 design used this strategy. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This turned out to not be a good idea. We tuned up the antenna at my dad's house. Then we packed
						up and went to a large open field by the school my sister worked at. When we reassembled the antenna
						we could not get the antenna tuned up. I, in a classic "shooting wildly in the dark" moment, wiggled 
						the feed wire and saw the tuning fluctuate wildy. It turns out that the postion of the jumper 
						from the coil to the radiating element was super critical. Moving it a little bit, drastically 
						changed the tuning of the antenna. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The feed point of the antenna is at a high voltage, around 160 volts. We theorized that there was 
						capacitive coupling between the jumper and the ground plane. When we noticed this we had run out 
						of time so we could not test if the position of the jumper that connected the tuning capacitors to 
						the bottom of coil was critical too. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We could not get rid of the capacitive coupling beteeen the feed point connection and the ground plain,
						physics is physics, but we could control the positioning so the coupling is the same each time.
						The goal for the V2 design was a repeatable design.
						We wanted to be able to assemble the antenna and get predicitable behavior every time we took it to
						a new location.

					<h3 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold mb-2">The Data - But First, Some Theory</h3>
					<p>
					Remember, our goal was to build an antenna that we could use to characterize performance 
					of an AM BCB receive antenna I built a few years ago. Also, we wanted to observe expected 
					R-Squared of signal strength. R-Squared perfomance is expected in the far field of the 
					antenna and it seems reasonable that it is better to be in the far field when characterizing 
					performance of the AM BCB receive antenna.
					</p>
					<p>
					So, an important question to answer is “Where, how far from my low power AM BCB antenna, 
					does the far field start?
					</p>
					<p>
					Initially that seemed like a relatively simple question. <strong>WRONG!</strong> As I surfed the internet 
					looking for information, I encountered a bewildering array of eye glazing, mind numbing 
					mathematical treatises on near and far field theory. And, a lot of the sources seemed to 
					be assuming reasonable sized antennas. But, one thing became clear. The far field starts 
					at least 1 wavelength from the antenna but probably more.
					</p>
					<p>
					So, before I discuss my results I would like  to present a little bit of the theory I 
					learned while  researching this section.

						One important characteristic for determing near and far field distances is whether the

					</p>
					<p>
						The radiating element is 10 feet (3 meters).

					<strong>This author says something different.</strong>
					<p>My "ka" is 0.063, way less than 1. By this author's criteria, the antenna qualifies as electrically short/small.</p>

					<h3 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold mb-2">Where Doe the Far Field Start for my Antenna?</h3>
					<p>
						Holy cow, what a journey! I still can't say for sure where far field starts but I suspect 
						there are more "It depends" factors than I currently understand. There is a lot of stuff
						I do not know.
					</p>
					<p>
						I started my journey with this Wikipedia article
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field. </a>
						It had a drawing and text, see below, that seemed like a pretty straight forward defintion of where the 
						far field starts for an electrically short/small antenna.

					<p>
						For antennas shorter than half of the wavelength of the radiation they emit 
						(i.e., electromagnetically "short" antennas), the far and near regional 
						boundaries are measured in terms of a simple ratio of the distance r from 
						the radiating source to the wavelength λ of the radiation. For such an antenna, 
						the near field is the region within a radius r ≪ λ, while the far-field is 
						the region for which r ≫ 2 λ. The transition zone is the region between r = λ and r = 2 λ.
					</p>
					<p>				
						Note that D, the length of the antenna is not important, and the approximation is the same 
						for all shorter antennas (sometimes idealized as so-called point antennas). In all such 
						antennas, the short length means that charges and currents in each sub-section of the 
						antenna are the same at any given time, since the antenna is too short for the RF 
						transmitter voltage to reverse before its effects on charges and currents are felt 
						over the entire antenna length.

					<h3 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold mb-2">Our Measurements - Did We See R-Squared?</h3>
					<h4 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold mb-2">Measured data</h4>
					<p>
						I read the signal strengths from the SDRuno spectrum display. The values are in the below table in the
						"Measured Signal Strength column." They are also plotted in the graph below the table. The measured data
						is the blue line with blue circles. Except for measurement 6, which I wll talk about later, the measurements
						seem to fall on a nice curve.
					</p>
					<h4 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold mb-2">Predicted data</h4>
					<p>
						There are four predicted data curves on the below graph. For the grey line with the triangle markers,
						I started with the measured value at 0.24 wavelengths and predicted the subsequent R-Squared values.
						I did the same for the other three predicted curves that start at 0.53, 0.79, and 1.04 wavelengths.
					</p>
					<p>
						The predicted data curves that start at 0.24 and 0.53 wavelengths have the same general shape as the
						measured data but have higher than expected values. However, the predicted data curves that start at 0.79
						and 1.04 wavelengths match the measured data pretty well. According to the above definition stated above
						for where the far field starts, I definitely was not in the far field. But, I can definitley talk
						myself in to concluding that we saw R-Squared behavior starting around 0.79 wavelengths.
					</p>
					<h4 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold mb-2">What's up with measurement position 6?</h4>
					<p>
						Notice how measurement 6 is above the curve.
						When I was taking the measurements I wrote "Local altitude maxima" in my notebook. Don't read too
						much in to that though. The measurements were taken in a corn field, it was relatively flat.
					</p>
					<p>
						I plotted the signal levels with respect to altitude.  My initial reaction was "The signal is higher
						because the sense antenna was higher at that location."
						But if that was the case I would expect measurement 5 to be lower, measurement 7 too.
						But, there is another but. By measurement 7 the signal was almost in the noise but
						I could still see it. I don't think there are any conclusioms I can make about any relationship
						between altitudes that vary by a maximum of 6 feet.
