<p>Notes</p>
<ol>
    <li>I bought 1 1/2, 2, and 2/ 1/2 inch T-handles from McMaster-Carr.</li>
    <li>I do not remember specifically where I bought the speaker wire. You can get it anywhere. I listed it above because I am a huge
        fan of Parts Express (parts-express.com). They are mostly an audiophile shop but they often have items I need. They ship quickly,
        and are responsive.</li>
    <li>Similar to Parts Express, I have always found McMaster-Carr a pleasure to deal with.</li>
