					<p class="text-left text-wrap">By October, 2020 the wife and I were getting pretty sick of the whole Covid thing. We are fortunate to 
													have jobs we can work from home. We are pretty good about 
													following the shelter at home recommendations but were ready for a change.
													We decided to get out of White Plains and go on a vacation the second week of October, 2020. 
													She picked out a great place,
													Opussum Creek Retreat, near Fayetteville, West Virginia. This is where the New River Gorge bridge is. 
													If you are going that way, I give an enthusiastic, unqualified 55 star recommendation for Opossum Creek Retreat.
													We rented a 2 bedroom cabin. The place was spotless, well provisioned, had a screened in porch with
													a hot tub, a grill, and a fire pit. Fantastic. Because it was a cabin in the woods, maintaining wise
													Covid 19 practices was easy.
					</p>
					<p class="text-left text-wrap">We asked my father to accompany us. He is a pretty chill guy. When I saw where we were going and my dad,
														an electrical engineer, said he would go with us, I immediately thought "I am going to take my radio stuff 
														and we can have some fun away from noisy White Plains, New York.""
					</p>
					<p class="text-left text-wrap"></p>I am fortunate to have a pretty cool wife who agreed this was a good idea, as long as 
													I made time for her too. So, what we ended up doing was the wife and I went hiking in the mornings and my 
													father and I played radio for 3 of the afternoons.

					<p>My father's summary - <q>We learned we don't know what the heck we are doing.</q></p>
					<p>True, but I prefer a gentler summary</p>
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item">1 - Relearned - RTDM (Read The Darn Manual). 
							<p>In our case the manual was the 
							ARRL Antenna Book, 22nd Edition. My eyes got drawn to the text showing
							the rule of thumb formula D=(2*L*L)/wavelength where L is <q>...largest dimension of the physical antenna...</q>. 
							At the time I concluded that we were OK. After all, this was the ARRL Antenna Handbook. As I recall, Dad was skeptical. 
							The piece of information I was missing, which is stated in the above referenced Wikipedia article, is that the formula 
							is only valid if L is a half wavelength or greater.
							</p>
							Text earlier in the section read 
							<q>For simple wire antennas, the reactive near field is considered to be within about a half
								wavelength from an antenna's radiating center.</q>
							<p>If we had read this before taking our measurements, we would have understood sooner that we
								would not see an r-squared relationship in our measurements.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">2 - We learned more about near and far fields.
							<p>Further reading:
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field" target="_blank">Wikipedia near and far field article</a>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="list-group-item">3 - We were able to get repeatable measurements. Always a good thing.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3 class="text-uppercase text-center font-weight-bold mb-2">What's Next? - Further Analysis</h3>
					<p>If we were fusion researchers we would ask for a gazillion more dollars and ten more years.</p>
					<p>The sources I read generally agree that the far field begins around 2 wavelengths. For 1 Megahertz, 
						that is 600 meters. My little transmitter does not have that kind of range. If I amp up the antenna 
						or increase signal strength, I would most likely be in violation of FCC regulations.
					</p>
					<p>I was thinking it'd be fun to try and measure the near field radiation pattern. My plan is to buy a 24 foot 
						painters pole and mount an antenna on top of it. I can vary the height of the pole and the range & 
						angle from the antenna. To get a longer range I will build and install a broadband step up transformer
						at the transmitter output.
					</p>
					<p>It may also be instructive to model my antenna and compare theoretical results to measured results.
						But, that may be easier said than done.
					</p>
					<p>Dad pointed out that I do not really have a ground plane on the transmitter's antenna. Adding one 
						is most likely a good idea. Also, a less than 1 meter long antenna for a 1 Megahertz transmitter
						may not be the best idea.
					</p>
					<p>It's pretty obvious there is lots more learning to be done.</p>
