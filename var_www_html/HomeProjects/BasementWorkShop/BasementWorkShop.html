					<p>
						I debated whether to do this page. It seemed a little self indulgent to show pictures and say how 
						great I think my workshop is. But, I really enjoy looking at and reading about other folk's workshops.
						There are a lot of clever folks out there and I get good ideas. It's fun. So, I decided to go 
						ahead and do this page to show you my workshop.
					</p>
					<p>In all the other places I have lived, I did not have the space or the time to set up as nice a workroom 
						as I would have liked. When I moved in to my current house we were almost empty nesters so I 
						had more time to set up the basement workshop I always wanted. My current workshop takes up about
						a third of the basement. I really like the space. It truly is my dream workroom.
					</p>
					<p>I mentioned elsewhere on this site that my daughter has inspired me to be more environmentally conscious.
						Michelle taught me the old phrase "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." While building out my workroom I have
						tried to buy as little new stuff as practical. The legs on the workbench are from a bunk bed set 
						someone put on the side or the road. I rescued the ham radio desk from the trash area at my 
						daughter's appartment building. The tool storage shelves and the chest of drawers are both 
						leftover structures from a loft bed my son no longer wanted. Many of the extra shelfs in the shelving
						units use wood left over from an old entertainment center. As much as possible, I try
						and use wood from my scrap lumber supply.
					</p>
					<p>A few years after I finished the first iteration of the workshop I was up in my attic and 
						realized we had a box of pictures that we had no wall space for. I put as many of these pictures
						up in the workshop as I could. It adds a nice personal touch. It also got some stuff out
						of the attic.
					</p>
					<p>It's been fun building out my workshop. Everything has a place and it is easier to get work done.

						<p>Let me tell you, the basement was rough when we moved in. Nasty flaking gold paint 
							on rough poured concrete walls that needed patching. The paint on the rafters was 
							so old that it would flake off when we walked around on the first floor. There were 
							two light bulbs in the entire basement.
						</p>
						<p>
							I patched and painted the poured concrete walls. For the patching I used DRYLOK FAST PLUIG Hydraulic Cement.
							I folllowed the patching with two coats of DRYLOK EXTREME  MASONRY WATERPROOFER, a coat of ZINSSER 123 Primer, 
							and then a final coat of Benjamin Moore Semi-Gloss Chantilly Lace.
						</p>
						<p>
							The walls were a lot of work but were nothing compared to the work done on the rafters.
							There is approximatley blah feet of rafter in my blah  by blah basement. I wire brushed 
							and scraped the all the rafters. Then I applied two coats of KILZ2 All Purpose Interior/Exterior Water Based Primer. 
							The final coat was Benjamin Moore Semi-Gloss Chantilly Lace. It came out nice. The basement seemed much brighter. 
							But, holy cow was it a lot of work. 
						</p>
						<p>
							You may notice that the floors are unpainted. The floor is an inch or two of concrete over mud.
							In spots, the concrete is breaking down. It has a sandy texture. After the first round of patching
							I was ready to paint the floor. Then I read up on it and realized I should hold off. The general 
							consensus out there on the web says to put down plastic over a section of your floor. If after a while you 
							see condensation under the plastic, this is an indication that moisture is migrating up 
							through the floor. The moisture would prevent paint from properly adhering to the floor.
							So, I decided not to paint the floor.
						</p>
						<p>
							The basement was a little damp when we moved in. I bought two dehumidifiers from Home Depot. 
							The dehumidifiers drain out to a Little Giant VCMA-15ULS Series 1/50 HP 1/2 Gallon Tank 
							Condensate Removal Pump. I bought both of mine on Amazon. I ran hose from the pumps
							to where the washer drain hose hooks to my utility sink. This keeps my basement dry and 
							I do not have to remember to empty out a dehumidifier resevoir.

							Until recently, spring of 2022, my ham radio equipment was in my upstairs office.
							That wasn't working for me. My  office had equipment for my job which has been remote for the 
							past few years. It also had my main computer I use for web site development and
							routine household based computer tasks. And finally, it had my radio hobby and ham radio equipment.
							As my son-in-law used to say "Too much stuff. Not enough space." I want a dedicated ham radio desk
							so I can sit down and do radio stuff without having to reconfigure the work area.
						</p>
						<p>
							After dropping my daughter off at her apartment complex, May of 2022, I noticed this desk next to the dumpster
							in the apartment's trash area. I needed a desk. I checked with the apartment concierge and he said "Sure, it's all yours."
							I had wanted something unique and this fills the bill.
