						Pretty Cool</h1>
					<p>Until this summer, 2023, my house was one of the crappier looking houses on the block.
						This year we finished the front porch rehab we started last year, got the house painted, and
						added
						some real nice trim to the front of the house. The place, from the front, really looks great.
					</p>
					<p> Part of the house painting contract was to patch and paint the concrete foundation visible on the
						sides
						and back of the house. When the contractor started prepping the concrete foundation
						for painting, a large portion of the foundation crumbled and flaked off. Our contractor 
						said, "Mister Rush, we need to talk." It was one of the	project's "HGTV moments."
					</p>
					<p>
						Even if I ignored the ugly looking foundation, the rest of the back of the house looked extra
						crappy
						next to the brand new painted parts of the house. Nothing has been done to the back stairs for
						at least
						7 years. The retaining wall was nasty, and the unpainted wooden basement door looked pretty
						awful.
					</p>
					<p>
						The wife and contractor proposed replacing the door. I was still in shock from the extra cost
						for the foundation repair so I proposed rehabbing the door. The wife was skepticl but agreed
						to let me take a shot at fixing up the door.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before starting the door rehab, I power washed the stairs and the retaining wall. Then I stained
						the stairs and painted the retaining walls.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am pleased with the results of this effort.
					</p>

					<p>The door was in pretty bad shape. My wife strongly advocated for replacement.
						My wallet was more in favor or refurbishment.
					</p>
					<p>I used a glue syringe to put glue under the loose wood. I am not sure whether the
						proper term is veneer or laminate. For this section, I will stick with the term veneer.
						I glued all the loose veneer. Then I patched and sanded the gouges, dings, and places
						where the veneer had broken away.
					</p>
					<p>I thought I was ready to paint. That was not the case.
					</p>
					<p>When I applied the primer there were a non-trivial number of areas where the veneer
						bubbled up. Crap!
					</p>
					<p>Where practical, I glued the veneer back down. For other areas, I broke out the 80 grit
						sandpaper and went to town. Eventually it got smooth enough for a basement entry door
						and I called it done.

					<p>To get ideas for this project, I searched "upgrade plain door with trim" in YouTube. There are
						lots of videos
						about dressing up plain doors with trim.
					</p>
					<p>At my house, my wife is the designer. I am the doer. I originally picked out trim with square
						edges.
						My wife said "That's nice, but dirt will collect on top of that." She was right. So,we went with
						the rounded trim you see in these pictures.
					</p>
					<p>In the final design, we made the ends of the three vertial pieces of trim pointed. The three
						pointy pieces are reminscent of the pointy tines on Zeuss's trident. And, they are not flat, so
						they don't get as dirty.
					</p>
					<div class="row">
						<p>Check out the picture on the right of the still unfinished door with the first half of the

					<p>Zeus comes from the factory unfinished. Fortunately for me, my son married a woman who

						I am an engineer. Sometimes we do post-project reviews where we discuss the "keys to

						We also discuss what went wrong but that is much less fun. The primary "key to success"

					<p>I am really happy with how this turned out.
					</p>
					<p>The back of the house looks better. But, like at any house, there is more to do.
						The patio needs some TLC. The retaining walls need another coat of paint. The retaining
						walls
						are full of soil but the only plant life in them is weeds.
					</p>
					<p>
						But you know what, it doesn't bother me. The back of the house looks better. My wife
						said
						"I can't believe how nice the door looks." Now, that doesn't suck!! We will
						get the other stuff as time and budget permits.
					</p>
					<p>
						I told the wife "Maybe their's an idea for an HGTV show for the rest of us." We could
						call it. "Gross to Good Enough" or "Crappy to Cool" or "Sucking Less is More."
