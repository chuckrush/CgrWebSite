<p>The Rush family owns a DVD with the full Fayetteville-Manlius 2010 Showboat performance.
    Can't really see any problems  with putting a clip from that DVD on the web.

<p>The Rush family also owns DVDs of the Fayetteville-Manlius 2009 and 2012 Wind Ensemble Concerto Concerts.
    Can't really see any problems with putting a clip from the DVDs on the web.
