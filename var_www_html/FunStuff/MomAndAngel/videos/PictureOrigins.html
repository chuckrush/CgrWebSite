<p>Our family has had these videos for quite a while. My guess, is the Letterman and World's Funniest Animals video are copyrighted material.
    It's also my guess that they'd be cool with using these. It's my mom for goodness sake. The video of Angel on the Scooter
    is owned by the Rush family.
