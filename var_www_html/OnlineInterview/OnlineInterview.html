            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <div align="left">
                <p>Welcome to Chuck Rush's work history page.</p>
                <p>
                    I spent most of 2012 and half of 2013 looking for a job. At that time I wished I had a way, other
                    than a resume, to show folks
                    what I have done over the years. I always thought a work experience web site would be a good idea.
                    I was working full time, had 1 kid at home, my wife was working down near New York City, and I was
                    looking for a job.
                    At that time I had no experience doing web programming and time was at a premium, so the site was
                    never created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, now, the kids are gone, and I have a job in the same area where my wife works. I work at
                    Persistent Systems
                    LLC in New York city. It is a really good place to work and I enjoy going to work every day. I have
                    no plans to work any other place.
                    Now that the kids are gone I have time to do professional development. Since I have folks on my team
                    who are web wizards,
                    it seemed like learning some more web programming was a good place to start.
                    Putting together a work experience web site, a long delayed project, was first on the schedule
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had some cool, interesting jobs over the years and have worked with some really great people.
                    Below is a summary of that work.

            <h1 id="bm_persistent_systems">Persistent Systems - Ad Hoc Networks - Programming</h1>
            <p>
                I started at <a href="https://www.persistentsystems.com/" target="_blank">Persistent Systems</a> July 8,
                2013. The company employed less
                than 30 at that time. Now we have close to 200 employees. The company did over 80 million in sales in
                2019. It has been quite a ride.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company was started by Dr. David Holmer, our C.T.O. and Dr. Herb Rubens, our C.E.O. These two
                guys are way, way, way smarter than the average bear. They have shepherded the company from two guys to
                its present size
                without taking one cent of venture capital money. What is impressive to me is they know how to let go as
                the
                company grows. They have hired a C.F.O., shipping and material managers, a seasoned H.R. professional
                and
                whatever else managerial and technical expertise needed to meet the needs of a growing company. I always
                feel like a
                suck up when I say it, but I have 100% faith in the leadership of this company.
            </p>
            <p>
                We all know that a company must make money to thrive and grow. Our leadership knows that too. But what I
                find
                really cool is that the leadership really and truly wants to design, manufacture, and sell a product
                that they
                truly believe our customers need. This applies to all our customers but even more so to our military
                customers.
                Our leadership and all our employees truly care and want to equip our armed forces with equipment that
                will
                enable them to do their jobs in the most effective way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Folks ask me "What does your product do." Internally, I always smile and think "It kicks ass!" but then I
                say
                "Have you seen the Terminator movie battle scenes with the swarms of drones, robots, and ground
                vehicles? If SkyNet
                was real, they would use Wave Relay&#174 products for their communications. Pop one of our embedded boards in
                every
                robot and BAM, you have a self forming, self healing network."
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't want to talk too much about what our product does or how it is used. I'd prefer the bad guys
                find that out first hand.
                But I will say it is a first class product, designed, built, maintained, and supported by a highly
                dedicated
                group of professionals.
            </p>

            <h2>Birth of the LCMR (Light Counter Mortar Radar) - Way Cool!</h2>
            I did not work on the LCMR while I was at Syracuse Research Corporation. However, it was one of the things
            that made me
            proud to work there.
            This <a href="JobHistoryContent\SRC\LCMR\Post-Standar-SRC-Radar-Innovation - 5-2-2010.pdf"
                target="_blank">article about the birth of the LCMR</a>
            is one of the coolest things you will ever read.
            <br /><br />
            <h2>Electronic Warfare Receiver - Software Lead</h2>
            Thinking back on this project always makes me smile. At SRC Bob Iodice was our Program Manager. Mike Addario
            and Jason Steeger were our
            hardware/FPGA guys. Jeff Fontanella and Jeff Mahon were our systems guys. It was a great crew. The program
            was called TRES, Threat Radar Emitter Simulator.
            SRC designed and built the the threat receiver for The Lockheed Martin crew out of Ridgecrest, California.
            The TRES guys were great too, Dave Tesdall
            was software lead, Frank Argain was their software guy. Bill Kinney and Gary Johnson were their systems
            guys. They were and still are, a great bunch.
            <br /><br />
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-5">
                    <p>
                        The TRES systems are used on aircraft training ranges to simulate enemy weapon systems. An
                        aircrew flies a simulated mission
                        and the TRES system locks on as a simulated enemy weapon system. The threat receiver monitors
                        the signals emitted by the radar and the
                        signals emitted by the aircraft when the flight crew employs counter measures. The receiver
                        generates reports of flight crew response
                        and the overall encounter. This information is used in post mission analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By volume, the threat receiver was a small part of the system. It received and analyzed radar
                        signals. Look for the small brown
                        box on the far left in the middle picture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was a challenging project. The TRES system is used to model many different threats. It
                        simulated a 360 degree surveillance
                        radar used to monitor a large air space. When a target was detected it would hand off the
                        contact to a monopulse tracking
                        TRES variant that simulated a missile system. There was also a shore based radar that pointed in
                        a particular direction and then
                        rotated left to right over a set number of degrees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my jobs was to modify the LCMR tracker to work with all three TRES variants, 360 degree
                        surveillance, a monopulse tracking system,
                        and a shore based ship detection radar. The software was configurable and there was one code
                        base for all the TRES variants.

                        Flying an aircraft to test a radar system is expensive and logistically difficult. To test the
                        tracker I needed a way to simulate flight paths.
                        It turns out there is an SDK for Microsoft Flight Simulator that allows you to get aircraft
                        position, speed, pitch, roll, yaw and many
                        other flight parameters. I wrote some code to grab the aircraft data and turn it in to radar
                        detection data. Then I would play
                        the data back and feed the detection data to the receiver and track my simulated flight. This
                        came in handy for testing. I was
                        happy when other projects used the code too. Never did get the hang of landing the aircraft
                        though.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I worked on TRES I worked on a similar system for a different customer. It was a classic
                        contract where the requirements
                        were created up front. We implemented to the requirements and delivered the system. The only
                        problem was. although we met the requirements,
                        the system did not really meet the customers needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the TRES project we had weekly telephone calls withe the customer to discuss program
                        progress and technical requirements.
                        At the end of the project the customer got exactly what they wanted and the systems worked
                        extremely well. In addition, as the
                        weeks went by we all got to know each other. Over time, real trust developed between us. Yes we
                        were a vendor supplying a customer
                        but we also became friends. I still occasionally call Frank Argain to chat. This project was one
                        of the high points of my career.

                    <p>
                        I don't have any super cool pictures of this project. The SRC part of this project was a radar
                        that could detect gas clouds. The original
                        concept was for the range to fire off an artillery shell with a simulated chemical agent. Then
                        an LCMR would detect the shell and tell the PAWSS
                        radar where to point. It also told a chemical sensor from another vendor to point at the cloud.
                        The PC hooked to the radar would gather data and pass
                        it off to an analysis package that determined the composition, size, density, etc of the gas
                        cloud. For the demo, there were no LCMRs available so
                        we just pointed the radar to where we knew the shell was going to detonate.
                    </p>
                    Another demo involved detecting and analyzing simulated chemical agents dispersed from an airplane.
                    An external radar, which was not available at the time, was supposed to cue our system. We ended up
                    relying on our eagle eyed systems
                    engineer, Jeff Fontanella. Without fail he was always the first one to spot the plane before any of
                    the rest of us.

                        I had the privilege of serving as the lead software engineer for the SRC Inc LSTAR&#174 radar. The
                        LSTAR&#174, at that time, came in two flavors, V2 and V3.
                        The V2 version fits in two large cases and can be transported in the back of an SUV. The V3
                        comes in more cases than can fit in an SUV. It is a 360 degree
                        air surveillance radar that excels at seeing and tracking low and slow flying objects.

                        Before I say any more about my work on LSTAR&#174 I want to say that everything described below was a
                        team effort. We had great software,
                        hardware, and systems folks on this project. In addition we had great leadership from the PM
                        level and up. SRC Inc is a well run
                        company with really good engineers. I also don't want to forget the non-engineering folks who
                        keep the company running, the product shipping,
                        the equipment working, and all the other things that keep a company running smoothly.

                        LSTAR&#174 was a young product when I took over as lead software engineer. It had been designed,
                        built, and installed at some initial locations
                        and was working well. It was time to grow the product.

                        At the same time drones were coming into their own and recognized as a threat. SRC started to
                        think about integrating various products they
                        manufactured in to a system of systems to fill the anti-drone role. We took the LSTAR&#174 various
                        demo and test events related to anti-drone functionality.

                        This project was ramping up when I transitioned from TRES Software Lead to LSTAR Software Lead.
                        At that time,
                        if you wanted to fly a drone in the national air space you had to either have eyes on the drone
                        while in flight, which
                        limits the operational range, or employ a chase plane to follow the drone around while it is
                        flying. Neither option
                        is viable at night time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This system employed LSTAR&#174 radars to monitor a volume of air apace around where drone flight
                        operations were done.
                        An SRC written application monitored the output of the radars and alerted the drone pilot when
                        an aircraft was approaching.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This prototype project was a success, we did fly unattended at night. But, there is always a but
                        in the engineering world, on the
                        second night a test application that was used after operations to test that the system was
                        operational failed. The system software was fine,
                        the test software malfunctioned. The team found the bug within 24 hours. It was simple, safe,
                        non-complex fix. Within 48 hours we
                        had generated a 57 page test report showing the fix worked. Nevertheless, the program was shut
                        down. It still hurts.

                        SRC Inc, working with the Army and its contractors, developed and deployed multiple GBSAA
                        systems. In November of 2018 I corresponded with
                        the Program Lead from the El Mirage Effort. He stated "...we now have 'Block 1 GBSAA' systems
                        fielded at 5 Army sites: Fort Hood, Fort Campbell,
                        Fort Bragg, Fort Campbell, and Fort Stewart. The system is working very well and the soldiers
                        love it - we now have supported over 1150 flights and nearly
                        4000 hours of UAS flights in the NAS."

                        GoldOne was a general radiology/fluoroscopic imaging system. In the old days the x-rays would
                        pass through your body and hit the x-ray film.
                        Then the film would be developed, put on a light box where a radiologist would read the film.
                        The GoldOne system replaced the film
                        cartridge with a CCD camera. The data is digitally captured and processed. This resulted in a
                        much lower dose to the patient and a more convenient work flow.
                    </p>

                        Infimed's product before GoldOne was getting old and sales were lagging. It was important to get
                        GoldOne done as quickly as possible.
                        The team worked 6.5 days a week for about 18 months. It was grueling. Fortunately, the team we
                        had was a fantastic group of engineers.
                        The fun thing about doing the device drivers was developing the code in parallel with the
                        hardware development. Working with a hardware
                        guy to bring up a brand new board was really fun.

                        I was hired to write Windows 95 device drivers for a set of custom designed PCI cards. There was
                        a RAID card,
                        a memory card, a display card, a scan converter card, and an x-ray film printer card. My device
                        driver experience before this job
                        consisted of copying code from a magazine for a Windows NT port driver. It was a risk hiring me.
                        Turned out OK though.
                        Rather than use the windows DDK, we bought a C++ based windows device driver package. At that
                        time there was very little
                        published information on windows device drivers. I found some articles and a book by Walter Oney
                        that saved the day. Thanks Walter!

                        through the system were implemented
                        in interrupt driven state machines. Windows 95 was not a real time operating system but through
                        careful design and implementation,
                        the system ended up working really well.

                        I worked on the PCI based Image Acquisition, Processing, and Display Board (IAPDB) from
                        conception, initial board programming, and development through production. The board had an
                        INTEL 80303 chip on it. The software on the chip controlled four Xilinx based PCI devices hung
                        on a secondary PCI bus on the card. The four Xilinx devices interfaced with a video image bus
                        connected to an InfiMed designed 1KX1K CCD camera.
                        Each of the Xilinx PCI devices had memory regions that mapped to control and status registers on
                        the device. Control values, image data, and video overlay data was written to the processing
                        chain every 33 milliseconds.
                        30 fps image data was transferred off the image bus by the Xilinx based PCI device and then
                        transferred using DMA to onboard memory on the IAPDB. From there image transfer and management
                        code on the 80303 chip transferred the image data to PC memory and eventually to an onboard disk
                        subsystem.
                        I designed, implemented, and tested the majority of the code on the IAPDB.
                        I also wrote the W2K driver the Windows application level used to communicate with the IAPDB.
                        I thoroughly enjoy working at the intersection of the hardware/software boundary. It is
                        challenging, rewarding, and a whole lot of fun.

                        correct the errors. I also wrote the low level interface code to communicate with the sensor.

            <h2>How I got the job</h2>
            I got this job after a 5 minute interview. My wife and I moved to Denver, Colorado from Macedonia, Ohio.
            Marlene had taken a new job with Leprino Foods, a cheese manufacturer. My plan was to go to to grad school.
            Initially I was looking at the Radiation Physics school at the University Hospital in Denver, Colorado.
            After talking with the folks there I decided Radiation Physics was not the job for me. At the end of my
            discussion with one
            of the professors he said "Hey, if you're looking for a part time job while you are in school, go see Vic
            Spitzer. He does computer stuff."
            I went to see Dr. Spitzer. He was on his way to an appointment so he had five minutes to talk with me. We
            chatted.
            He gave me a key and said "You're hired. I need that SUN4 to talk to that automated video to film camera."

            <h2>First day on the job</h2>
            It was not too tough of a task. The camera had a standard RS-232 port. The SUN4 had a serial port that could
            do RS-232 and RS-485.
            The lab did not have an oscilloscope and I did not have any RS-232 breakout hardware. On my first day on the
            job I figured out that
            the only way to tell what the port was configured for was to check a jumper on the SUN4 processor card. I
            figured the lab folks would
            not want their system disassembled during the day so I left and came back after 10:00pm. The first time I
            saw Dr. Spitzer, Vic, after
            the interview was after midnight with his computer disassembled all over the lab floor. It didn't phase him
            a bit. Vic was and I
            imagine still is, a pretty cool dude. He reminded me of Doc in the Back to the Future movies.

            <h2>What I did while working at the Anatomical Visualization Lab</h2>
            After I had been working at the lab for a while, a guy named Dr. Karl Reinig wandered in and inquired about
            working at the lab. Dr. Reinig had his own computer graphic/visualization business he ran out of his house.
            Dr. Reinig was and I imagine still is a wizard, way smarter than the average bear. His presence at the lab
            supercharged us all. That guy could do math, visualization, and physical modeling code that makes ordinary
            folk's heads explode. I on the other hand am more of a get things done, production engineer kind of guy.
            Together we made a powerful team. I was content being his right hand man.

            <p>
                The lab came up with the name Cryogenic Macrotome for the system that processed the cadaver sections.
                A Bridgeport mill was used to do grind off a millimeter at a time from the cadaver section. It was
                retrofitted
                with a numerical control system for the X and Z axis. I programmed the system to perform the slicing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three cameras were used to capture each slice, a video camera, a 42 bit digital color camera, and a film
                camera.
                The cameras were attached to mechanical slide system on the ceiling. A stepper motor was used to
                position the cameras
                during the image acquisition process. Each camera came with a remote to trigger the camera. I acquired a
                set of
                Opto-22 digital I/O modules. These were used to trigger image capture on each camera.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote a program on a PC to control and coordinate the image acquisition process. That was quite an
                adventure.
                I used Borland C++ 3.0. Only problem was I had never done C++ and had only written one or two C programs
                ever.
                Previous programming experience was in PLM86. The code would not win any prizes in a coding contest.
                But, most importantly,
                the program got the job done and contributed to the success of the Visible Human project.

            <p>
                Dr. Reinig did some of that PhD magic and found us a 3D edge detection algorithm. I implemented it and
                we ran it on the anatomical data captured by the cryogenic macrotome. No edge detection algorithm
                works perfectly. It was necessary to correct the output from the edge detection algorithm. The first
                computer
                we used for image processing was a PIXAR computer. It was a system that you loaded the 3D data in to.
                The
                hardware was structured so you could access the data in different image planes. I wrote programs using
                their
                GUI package, RAP. For each slice the user was presented with image data overlaid with edge data. The
                user
                corrected the edge data. When a contiguous edge encapsulated an anatomical feature, the user would do a
                flood fill
                of the enclosed area. This flood filled edge/overlay then was saved as the mask image for that slice.
                In the above carousel see Helen Pesters MATLAB segmentation tool. Helen was a colleague. She wrote that
                tool
                after I left the lab. Also see the image with caption "Raw Image, Edge Detection, Feature Segmentation,
                Feature Masks"

            <h3>Data Manipulation and Access Library</h3>
            <p>
                The Visible Human data set is huge. As we started using the data, we realized it would be nice to have a
                standard
                interface we could use to access the data. The library I wrote had interfaces to access data slices in
                all three planes,
                arbitrary 2D areas from a slice, or arbitrary 3D chunks from the data set.
                In addition, we sometimes had lighter weight applications that did not require full resolution data. We
                generated some
                reduced resolution data sets. One of them was an 8 bit indexed color data set.

                Dr. Reinig and I were sitting in a Chinese restaurant eating lunch. Karl got "that look" on his face
                that told me were were going to have some fun. He said "Chuck, we should make a Celiac plexus block
                simulator."
                Being game for anything and not knowing what the heck a Celiac plexus block was I said "Cool, sign me
                up."
                We made a fiberglass model of the Visible Male's back. Inside the model we placed a Sensible Devices
                force feedback device.
                A needle was attached through the back to the force feedback device. We had a segmented 3D model of the
                Visible Male's
                thorax and abdomen which we virtually placed inside the physical model of the back. At any point, we knew
                where the needle was in
                the anatomy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When doing a needle stick, the interventional radiologist uses fluoroscopic imaging to visualize
                placement of the needle.
                We acquired a foot switch similar to one used in a fluoroscopy lab. Since we had a complete CT scan of
                the Visible Male we
                were able to generate simulated fluoroscopic images to show the location of the needle in the anatomy. We
                could also show
                the anatomical data so the trainee could visualize the anatomy the needle was traveling through. The
                port driver for
                the force feedback device was my first exposure to a device driver in Windows. I did all the work
                described
                in this paragraph. It was cool, but Dr. Reinig's contribution was even cooler.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Reining did the force feedback modeling code. When you entered a muscle in the virtual back, the
                slight pop was
                transmitted to the needle. The extra force needed to slide through the muscle was also transmitted by
                the force feedback device.
                If the needle hit a bone, the force feedback model would not let the needle move. Like I said, Karl was
                smarter than the average bear.

            The main product line at that time was the Tire Uniformity Optimizer (TUO). The TUO measured radial force
            variation, radial runout, lateral runout.
            With the addition of sidewall appearance probes, the user could also monitor for sidewall bulges.
            <br>
            Before I started at Akron Standard the TUOs were set up to run a particular tire size.
            When a manufacturer wanted to measure a different size tire the machine was shut down while the mechanics,
            using
            wrenches and other tools, adjusted the machine for the new tire size.
            The system I worked on was called a flexible TUO. An in-plant tracking system would tell the TUO
            the characteristics
            of the next tire to be tested. When the current test was finished and the tire was being dismounted and sent
            on its way,
            the TUO was already adjusting itself as much as possible for the next tire size.
            <br>

            I was lucky enough to be the developer for the Automatic Sidewall Appearance Monitor (ASAM).
            <br>
            I also did work on light truck machines.
            As well as the D90, a machine for testing truck tires. That thing was huge.

                High <em>Cool Factor</em> on this one.
                One of my bucket list items is to walk on all seven continents. Antarctica was my fifth.
                I worked with Dr. David Bromwich at the Ohio State University Institute for Polar Studies (Now called
                Byrd Polar Research Center).
                I did programming for him to analyze meteorological data for about a year.
                Then I applied for the trip to Antarctica with Dr. Ian Whillans.
                Before the trip I built a set of cables to hook solar panels to the <a

                    Transit
                </a> satellite receivers used to measure locations. Transit was a precursor to GPS developed in the late
                50s and was used until 1991.
                During the expedition my duties were performing distance measurements on pre-existing survey grids,
                gathering weather data, drilling ice cores,
                and placing satellite receivers at various locations to measure ice stream flow.

                    <p>
                        Once we got to Ice Stream B, a C-130 came every couple of weeks to bring food, fuel, and most
                        importantly, mail from my girlfriend.
                        This is the final part of the landing sequence.
                        Before landing the C-130 would fly over the ice and drag its skis along the ice. Then it would
                        ascend and fly over where it had
                        dragged the skis and look for any crevasses that may have been uncovered. If the landing area
                        looked safe, then and only then would it land.

                        There were four newbies on the Ohio State crew. Attendance at a two day survival school was mandatory. 
                        I remember three main topics that were covered, building shelter, rappelling, and how to stop yourself
                        from sliding down a steep incline or a crevasse.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        We were required to build a shelter and spend the night in it. It was a lot of work.
                        Thankfully, there were four of us so it wasn't too bad. It was a bit crowded in the shelter though.

                        Burrow in to the snow mound and remove your gear. Then hollow out the inside of the mound until
                        you have enough room for your crew. It was not spacious. My most vivid memory of that night  
                        was snow occasionally falling on my face.

                        We also learned how to stop ourselves if we fell and were sliding down a steep incline. It involved
                        using an ice axe to 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl4zyip2_Ds" target="_blank">stop yourself from sliding.</a>
                        It was easy to do in a training situation but I 
                        worried that in a real life situation I would be just as likely to stab myself in the chest with the
                        ice axe.

                    <p>
                        We also did some rappelling. If you were to fall in to a crevasse, rescuers could toss 
                        down a rope and you could rappel to safety.

                    <p>
                        We ate really well at Ice Stream B. The cook was a chef from a fancy big city hotel.
                        In Antarctica, the cost of the food is the smallest part of the cost of the food so
                        the expedition bought high quality food. I liked eating at Ice stream B. I
                        spent most of my time at the remote camps so my partner and I had to cook for ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Ice Stream B there were two large Jamesway huts, our tents, and the latrine. One Jamesway hut was the dining hall.
                        The other Jamesway was for the team's equipment and a place to gather in the evenings to work and socialize. 
                        I have nice memories of Andrea Donnellan playing her guitar and singing.

                        The transit satellite receivers we used for geolocation of the survey grids were much less accurate than
                        modern day GPS receivers. To get better accuracy, for the duration of the expedition, a stationary satellite receiver
                        was positioned at each remote camp. The primary mission of the folks at the remote camps was to ensure the satellite 
                        receiver was running at all times. The only other required task was to periodically gather
                        temperature, wind speed, and wind direction data.

                    <strong>There were two primary data gathering efforts at Ice Stream B</strong>
                    <p>
                        There was a large survey grid close to and directly south of Ice Stream B. Kelly Beatley and I spent a number of 
                        days surveying that grid. We would place a reflector on one pole, drive to adjacent poles, and measure the distance 
                        with a laser range finder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were designated survey sites located all over the ice stream. A crew of two would be flown to the sites. 
                        At each site they would deploy the satellite receiver, put up a photogrametric target, and drill an ice core.
                        As I recall, the satellite receiver was  left at the site for a number of days. The ice core was preserved and
                        eventually transported back to Ohio State for analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After we returned home, a C-130 flew over the ice stream and photographed the entire ice stream. I believe
                        the motion of the ice stream was analyzed using both the position data from the satellite receivers and 
                        from an analysis of the photogrametric data.

                        Dr. Ian Whillans gave me a great piece of advice for doing effective presentations. "Tell them what you are going to tell them.
                        Tell them. Then tell them what you told them." It works! Thanks Ian.

                        At the time of the expedition, November 1985 to February, 1986, my uncle was a General in the Army Reserve. 
                        While attending orientation for the expedition in Washington D.C., Kelly Beatley and I visited him at the Pentagon. 
                        He gave us an Army Reserve banner to take to Antarctica.

                        I clearly remember being hungry the entire time I was at survival school. My guess is Rob Mellors was
                        also hungry. The food was granola bars and cereal. I guess that made the experience more realistic.

            <p>
                I realize it is not customary to include college jobs after you have been working for a while. However,
                solar pond technology is kind of cool so I decided to include it.
                I worked there for a couple of years as a research assistant.
                One of my jobs was to build and program a multi-channel data acquisition system controlled by an HP
                calculator.<br>
